# Cloudnine

Cloudnine is a web application that generates Spotify playlists designed to elevate the listener's mood. To do this, it takes into account the user's current state of mind (as rated by the user) in addition to the current weather conditions in the user's geographic area. The goal is to counteract the effects of seasonal depression.

The application is being built by [University of Surrey](https://surrey.ac.uk) students as part of a software engineering coursework assignment.
